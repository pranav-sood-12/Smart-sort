# Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a hardware machine that can semi-automate the process of sorting nuts and bolts using machine learning. The machine will be controlled by a microprocessor and will use a combination of hardware design, software programming, and machine learning techniques to identify and sort nuts and bolts based on their characteristics. 

Hardware Design: The hardware design of the machine will involve designing and building a conveyor belt system that can transport nuts and bolts to the sorting mechanism. The sorting mechanism will consist of a set of sensors and cameras that will collect data about the size, shape, and color of the nuts and bolts. This data will be fed to the microprocessor, which will use machine learning algorithms to classify and sort the nuts and bolts. 

Software Programming: The software programming aspect of the project will involve developing the machine learning algorithms that will be used to classify and sort the nuts and bolts. The algorithms will be trained on a dataset of nuts and bolts with known characteristics to identify patterns and make predictions about the characteristics of new nuts and bolts. The microprocessor will also be programmed to control the conveyor belt system and the sorting mechanism based on the output of the machine learning algorithms.
